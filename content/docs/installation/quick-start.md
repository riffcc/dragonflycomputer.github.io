You can install Dragonfly on any macOS or Linux system.

For Linux installations, we suggest using Debian or Ubuntu or running the Docker image, although you may have luck with other distributions.

### Docker
You can run Dragonfly using Docker Compose:

Save this file as `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  dragonfly:
    image: ghcr.io/riffcc/dragonfly:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - dragonfly-data:/var/lib/dragonfly
    environment:
      - RUST_LOG=info

volumes:
  dragonfly-data:
```

Then run:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Visit the web interface at `http://localhost:3000`
(or `http://your-hostname:3000` if you're not running it locally)

For more details on running Dragonfly with Docker, see the [Docker guide](/docs/installation/docker).
