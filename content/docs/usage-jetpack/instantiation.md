Jetpack allows you to provision virtual machines or Linux containers (LXCs) on-demand,
creating them "just-in-time" ahead of applying a playbook to your newly created nodes.

We call this process "instantiation" - creating nodes as needed.

More information will be available soon. (Dragonfly v0.2.0).
