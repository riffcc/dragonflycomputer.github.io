Spark is a powerful PXE boot agent that allows you to enable remote management of your entire network.

You can enable Spark on a machine by simply enabling boot-to-network as your default boot option on any machine on a network with a running Dragonfly deployment.

More information coming soon in Dragonfly v0.2.0.
