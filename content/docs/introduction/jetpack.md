Jetpack is a powerful Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage your infrastructure. Inspired by the simplicity of popular declarative IaC tools, Jetpack makes it easy to manage your infrastructure.

It combines functionality seen in tools such as Ansible and Terraform, providing a unified approach to infrastructure management, and **integrates with Dragonfly** for graphical management of all your automation workflows.

Jetpack is based on the Jetporch project by Jetporch contributors including Michael DeHaan.
