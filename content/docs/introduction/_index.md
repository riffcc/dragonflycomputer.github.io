Thanks for checking out Dragonfly!

Dragonfly is a *metal management* system. It is designed to make it easy to
take unconfigured hardware and turn it into fully functional servers and networks.

This means you can take a computer out of the box, network boot it, and be running your favourite operating system in minutes.

Dragonfly also provides [Spark](/docs/components/spark/), a lightweight, distributed agent that can optionally be used to manage your computers and perform monitoring and management tasks.
